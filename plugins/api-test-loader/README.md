# API Test Loader

This project contains a theia plugin that supports automatically grabbing all the tests in the workspace and running them.

## Getting Started

To develop this project you must be cloned into the plugins directory of where theia was cloned.
E.g. 
If theia is cloned in /projects/theia
then you must clone this repo in /projects/theia/plugins

Then you must open up the project in vscode/theia so that it can resolve the launch configuration correctly.
